# ReactiveContext

ReactiveContext is a class that manages the reactivity of a context, and manages the subscriptions and helpers.
Instance of this class is returned from the `$reactive` service after using it.
Using this object you can define:

* Meteor Subscriptions - wraps `Meteor.subscribe` and provides the acknowledgment when the subscription updates.
* View Helpers - you can define helpers and use them in your view, and Angular-Meteor will take care of your view reactivity.
* Define view reactive variables - use `getReactively` to define reactive variables and attach them to your view.
