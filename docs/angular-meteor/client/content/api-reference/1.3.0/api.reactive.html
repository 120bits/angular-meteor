# $reactive

A service that takes care of the reactivity of your Meteor data, and updates your AngularJS code.

This service wraps context (can be used with `this` or `$scope`) - so you can use it with any context as you wish:

* Use it with `$scope` when writing AngularJS 1.x.x code.

* Use it with `this` when working with AngularJS 1.x.x with components code-style.

* Use it with `this` when working with AngularJS 2 (or angular2now) with components.
