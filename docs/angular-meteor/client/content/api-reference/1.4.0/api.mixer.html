# Mixer
<a class="src-code" href="https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor/blob/master/packages/angular-meteor-data/modules/angular-meteor-mixer.js" target="_blank">
  src: angular-meteor-data/modules/mixer.js
</a>

A service which lets us apply mixins into the `ChildScope` prototype. The flow is simple. Once we define a mixin, it will be stored in the `$Mixer`, and any time a `ChildScope` prototype is created it will be extended by the `$Mixer`. This concept is good because it keeps our code clean and simple, and easy to extend. So any time we would like to define a new behaviour to our scope, we will just use the `$Mixer` service.

As for now, `angular-meteor` consists of 4 mixins,
 [$$ViewModel](api/1.4.0/viewmodel),
 [$$Core](api/1.4.0/core),
 [$$Reactive](api/1.4.0/reactive) and
 [$$Auth](api/1.4.0/auth).
As you can probably notice these mixins has a notation of a '$$' sequence since noramlly they should not be exposed as part of our API but they are still making for a convinient way to seperate our logic into different segments.

If you would like to create your own mixin follow the methods below, or you can take a look at [angular-meteor-auth](https://github.com/Urigo/angular-meteor/blob/master/packages/angular-meteor-auth/angular-meteor-auth.js) module as an example.
